# Findkeywords_pytrends
In this project I used to create a application using tkinter, pytrends and Pandas.

This is a simple project where I create a single window application that asked the user to enter a keywords 
and using that keyword it will search in pytrends and suggest you related keywords.

I hope you enjoy it.

I would suggest you to activate a virtual environment using
Ubuntu
source venv/bin/activate
then install libraries for that I add a requirements.py file to install all dependancies and libraries.
Just install 

pip3 install -r requirements.py

and you are done.
