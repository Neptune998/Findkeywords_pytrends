# Findkeywords_pytrends
In this mini project I create a application using tkinter, pytrends and Pandas.

This is a simple project where I create a single window application that asked the user to enter a keywords 
and using that keyword it will search in pytrends and suggest you related keywords.

I hope you enjoy it.

# Follow the steps to use it.

First of all clone the repo using 

`git clone https://github.com/Neptune998/Findkeywords_pytrends.git`

After that activate the environment-to activate a virtual environment in Linux

`source venv/bin/activate`

Then install libraries for that-I add a requirements.py file to install all dependancies and libraries.

Just run the below cmd

`pip3 install -r requirements.py`

Now use the application.
For any issue feel free to contact me.

**That's it.**
